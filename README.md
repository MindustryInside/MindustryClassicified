Have you ever wanted to play Mindustry, but was dissatisfied with how much 5.0 changed compared to 3.5?  
Then this mod is **for you**!

It is maintained by [BasedUser](https://github.com/BasedUser) and [Felix Corvus](https://github.com/Remint32)

### Releases
We do not provide pre-packaged releases as main, because we use a rolling model - just [download the zip archive](https://github.com/BasedUser/MindustryClassicified#downloads) of the necessary branch (mindustry version & art style) using github.

## Overview
  - Every block is now pixelated.
  - Forgotten blocks return!
  
And in the experimental branch,
  - an attempt to replicate 3.5 gameplay.

All new/modified blocks are carefully redrawn with full respect for the original style, palette, and using old sprites.  
Hope you enjoy this mod, as we have making it!
