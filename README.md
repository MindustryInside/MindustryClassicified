### Releases
We do not provide pre-packaged releases as main, because we use a rolling model & and no build required - just [download the zip archive](https://github.com/BasedUser/MindustryClassicified#downloads) of the necessary branch (mindustry version & art style) using github.

## Overview
  - Every block is now pixelated.
  - Forgotten blocks return!
  
And in the experimental branch,
  - an attempt to replicate 3.5 gameplay.

***
All new/modified blocks are carefully redrawn with full respect for the original style, palette, and using old sprites.  
Hope you enjoy this mod, as we have making it!
